But here&rsquo;s the thing — I&rsquo;ve been digging into the EU AI Act for my research, and this little number got me curious.

At different stages of this journey, we find ourselves with varying levels of expertise and problem-solving skills. A frequent question that comes up is, what sets a senior developer apart from a middle-level developer? The answer may surprise you: It&rsquo;s less about the code you write and more about the problems you solve.</p><h2 id=defining-roles>Defining Roles</h2><p>Middle Developers: Generally, middle developers are proficient in coding and can build features, fix bugs, and understand the project at a reasonable depth. They are essential team members who contribute significantly to the codebase.</p></div><div class="entry__meta meta mt tar"><time class="entry__meta-published meta-published" datetime=2023-10-27T14:10:21+03:00>October 27, 2023</time><div class="entry__meta-tags meta-tags"><span class=meta-tags__list>Tags:

We are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli, and it can seem like the only way to keep up is to do more than one thing at a time. However, research has shown that multitasking is actually less productive than focusing on one task at a time.</p><p>When we multitask, our brains have to constantly switch gears between tasks. This takes time and effort, and it can lead to errors and mistakes. In addition, multitasking can reduce our focus and concentration, making it difficult to complete any task well. Research also show that multitasking can lead to stress and anxiety, which can have a negative impact on our health and well-being.</p></div><div class="entry__meta meta mt tar"><time class="entry__meta-published meta-published" datetime=2023-07-17T14:10:21+03:00>July 17, 2023</time><div class="entry__meta-tags meta-tags"><span class=meta-tags__list>Tags:

It&rsquo;s a document that describes a new feature or a change to the existing system. It should describe a problem and proposed solution.

I was working full-time as a software engineer and I was doing my masters part-time. The masters journey was challanging but doable, and I finished cum laude. So I started to talk with other PhD students, why they are doing it, how they do it, etc. Appeared, that everyone has their own reasons and their own way of doing it. The main reasons for my peers were the interest in the topic and the desire to learn more about the topic. Many mentioned that they are not interested in teaching, but research is something that facinates them.</p></div><div class="entry__meta meta mt tar"><time class="entry__meta-published meta-published" datetime=2023-06-28T14:10:21+03:00>June 28, 2023</time><div class="entry__meta-tags meta-tags"><span class=meta-tags__list>Tags:
