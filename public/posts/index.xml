      <description>Multitasking is a common practice in today&amp;rsquo;s world. We are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli, and it can seem like the only way to keep up is to do more than one thing at a time. However, research has shown that multitasking is actually less productive than focusing on one task at a time.
When we multitask, our brains have to constantly switch gears between tasks. This takes time and effort, and it can lead to errors and mistakes.</description>

      <description>Today my colleague shared that they started to use RFCs inside of their development team. I was surprised in a way that I thought &amp;ldquo;why it&amp;rsquo;s not a common practice?&amp;rdquo;. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s not a common practice because I never used it in my previous companies. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice and I want to share it with you.
What is RFC? RFC stands for Request for Comments.</description>

      <description>How it started My PhD journey started in 2022. I was working full-time as a software engineer and I was doing my masters part-time. The masters journey was challanging but doable, and I finished cum laude. So I started to talk with other PhD students, why they are doing it, how they do it, etc. Appeared, that everyone has their own reasons and their own way of doing it. The main reasons for my peers were the interest in the topic and the desire to learn more about the topic.</description>
