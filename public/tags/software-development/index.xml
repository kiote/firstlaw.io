      <description>Today my colleague shared that they started to use RFCs inside of their development team. I was surprised in a way that I thought &amp;ldquo;why it&amp;rsquo;s not a common practice?&amp;rdquo;. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s not a common practice because I never used it in my previous companies. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice and I want to share it with you.
What is RFC? RFC stands for Request for Comments.</description>
