Now I Have Questions.</title><link>https://firstlaw.io/posts/bolt-driving-score/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://firstlaw.io/posts/bolt-driving-score/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I rented a Bolt van, and at the end of my trip I got a score: 97/100 for my driving style. Cool, I guess? But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing — I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging into the EU AI Act for my research, and this little number got me curious. Where does a system like this actually fall under the new rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any insider info on how Bolt&amp;rsquo;s scoring works, so think of this as me working through the question out loud rather than any kind of legal verdict.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
