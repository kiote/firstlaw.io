First Law of Robotics: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

Second Law of Robotics: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

Third Law of Robotics: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

## About me

My name is Ekaterina Krivich and currently I live and learn in Estonia. I am a PhD student at Tallinn University. My research interests are in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, specifically in the area of emotion recognition and affective computing. I am also interested in the field of Design Thinking and Design Research.

I also work for many years as a software developer.

I have an interest in making technology understandable by everyone, so I work together with [ITTalent](https://www.ittalent.ee/) and teach technical recruiters.
